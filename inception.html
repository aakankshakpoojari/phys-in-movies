        <h2>Poetic Ending</h2>
        <p>Inception introduces the idea that time flows differently in dreams. While dreams may seem longer than reality, the film exaggerates this effect significantly.
            The film ends with Cobb spinning his totem. If it falls, he’s in the real world. If it keeps spinning forever, he’s still dreaming. But before we get the answer, the screen cuts to black.

That final moment sparked endless debates — was it real or not? Nolan never confirms it, because the point is: Cobb doesn’t care anymore. He’s finally at peace.

        <h2>just a meme</h2>
        <p>This movie has left me with never-ending-series of questions. ok first if its their dream and they can imagine anything,then why are they ahving such a hard time fighting the 'bad guys'(npcs)?why cant they just imagine
            something really cool armoured suits/cars or whatever (im sure armoured cars exist).
        And can they even stick to one goddamn rule? youre saying once u die in a dream-u wake up in real world :OK,and it changes later -if u die in the dream u enter the 'limbo'? :EXCUSE ME? </p>

        <h2>Movie Rating – IMO</h2>
        <div class="rating">
            <p><strong>Score: 8/10</strong></p>
            <p>While Inception creatively uses dream physics, most of its ideas are theoretical and rooted in cinematic storytelling rather than established science.
                AND WHY WASNT CILLIAN MURPHY IN THE MOVIE POSTER?BECAUSE HE'S NOT ONE OF THE DREAM SNATCHERS?(or whatever their profession is)idc anyways
